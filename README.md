# Cosmogravity-V2
Same application, new architecture
See V1 code [here](https://github.com/Migoyan/Cosmogravity_2021)


Instruction :
	- Compile ts directory into js directory
	- Retrieve "require" that call module from node_module/@types in your js files. Libraries will be simply loaded by the html page. Browserify will not work if you keep those.
	- Use browserify on your main.js only to adapt the code to web page and put it in src.
	The library are not installed by node for js part. Kept only the require that call classes.
	- Call library and your file generated by browserify into your html page and voil√†.

On your server, you can delete ts and js directories to gain space.
